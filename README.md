This software tool is developed under a MSc thesis project in Delft University of Technology.

The thesis project:

Construction schedule optimisation: Optimisation of BIM-based, component-level construction schedule for building structural and MEP systems considering parallel working zones

The full report can be found at TU Delft Repository: http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:eeed7784-9632-4ecb-932e-74f49d5aea99

***********

This software tool is an implementation of the conceptual framework described in the report (on activity sequencing, clustering & splitting, and schedule optimisation).

As a high-level overview, **this tool reads information from 3D building model(s), takes in user preferences, and produces automatically as output optimised schedule(s) for the building.**

Overview of the functionalities:

1. Read component information from BIM (.ifc) file into Excel spreadsheet

2. Map the components with their activity, duration, cost and resource data in the database

3. Formulate, solve and display the result of the MOO problem, after taking user inputs

4. Write the schedule into Excel and then Microsoft Project

This tool consists of three parts:

1. Excel add-in

2. MATLAB standalone executable programme

3. Excel macro workbook
